Please see
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=166634&package_id=268019
for some scripts to compile PokerTH using mingw.

The scripts are also provided in the win32_build_scripts subdirectory, but they
require specific download and uncompression tools to run, which are provided
with the package at the upper link.

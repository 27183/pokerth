PokerTH can be built for Windows using MXE (the M cross environment)
http://mxe.cc/

You need a Linux system to set this up.

1. Install all requirements listed there:
http://mxe.cc/#requirements
on your Linux system.

2. Download the latest release of MXE and extract it to /opt/mingw
(if this does not work, as some packages might be broken, try the latest development release)

3. Patch OpenSSL dependencies out of Qt build file (OpenSSL license is not compatible with the GPL)
For your convenience, a patch file is included to remove at least one OpenSSL dependency. This patch
is without warranty, you need to make sure for yourself that you do not link to OpenSSL.
Within /opt/mingw, run
patch -p1 < /path/to/pokerth/docs/win32_rm_openssl.diff

4. Within /opt/mingw, run
make gcc
make qt
make boost
make curl
make libgsasl
make sdl_mixer
make tinyxml
make libircclient
(this takes quite some time)

5. As the user you would like to use to compile PokerTH for Windows,
add the cross compiler to your path; e.g.:
PATH="/opt/mingw/usr/bin:$PATH"
(in .profile)
Alternatively, run
export PATH="/opt/mingw/usr/bin:$PATH"

6. Download and extract whichever source version of PokerTH you wish to compile.

7. Within the pokerth directory, run
i686-pc-mingw32-qmake DEFINES+=BOOST_THREAD_USE_LIB pokerth.pro
make release

PokerTH can also be built using MinGW or Visual Studio on Windows,
but neither method is supported, because it takes too much time to keep
several methods updated.

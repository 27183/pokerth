How to skinning PokerTH GUI
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+++++++++++++++++++++++
1. Game Table Styles
+++++++++++++++++++++++

1.1 Start building a game table
--------------------------------
The best way to start building a custom PokerTH game table is to take a look into defaulttablestyle.xml. 
You will find this file in the source code or into your >= 0.6.5 installation path of PokerTH in subfolder data/gfx/gui/table/default/.
The defaulttablestyle.xml is the control center of your style. The file also contains comments which describe the use of the controls.

Maybe you like to play around with the default table to see how the controls will work. Therefore you should copy the whole
data/gfx/gui/table/default/ directory to another place. For better overview in "game table styles" list in settings please at first change 
<StyleDescription value="PokerTH default table style" /> to <StyleDescription value="my custom style" />. Maybe you also like to rename the
defaulttablestyle.xml to mycustomstyle.xml or something similar and directory name "default" to "mycustomtable" or something similar.
Now you can start tweaking color values or change/edit gfx files.


1.2 Test your style
--------------------------------
To test your style just load it into PokerTH with "Settings" -> "Style" -> "Game Table Styles" --> "Add ...".
When you have selected your file the value of "StyleDescription" is shown in the list. Select this entry in the list and click "Activate". 
Closing the Settings dialog will refresh the style of the game table.

If you do changes in your mycustomstyle.xml there is no need to re-add it into settings or restart PokerTH. The simplest way is just
to open settings dialog and close it immediately. This will refresh the game table style and show your changes.


1.3 Distribute your style
-------------------------------
When your style is ready to distribute you should complete the style information StyleDescription, StyleMaintainerEMail and Preview. 
The best way for Preview will be a screenshot of the style running in PokerTH.

Next step is editing the copyright.txt. Here you need to change "Maintainer" to your name and "EMail" to your valid mail address. 
Please read the copyright declaration carefully. If you edited a free licenced gfx file you need to add the source address of the file 
and corresponding licence information.

If you style is ready to be shipped please pack the whole directory into a zip archive and send it to anybody you like. If you like your 
style to be added into skin gallery on http://www.pokerth.net please send the archive to webmaster@pokerth.net. We cannot promise that 
every style will be added, but if everything works fine and the legal issues are also clear there should be no problem.

2. Card Deck Styles
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

2.1 Start building a card deck
--------------------------------
Setup a card deck is not so complex like the game table. The xml file is only used for StyleDescription, StyleMaintainerEMail and Preview.
Going throught the data/gfx/cards/default/defaultdeckstyle.xml you will find the needed infos to set this values.

Maybe you like to play around with the default card deck. Therefore you should copy the whole data/gfx/cards/default/ directory to another place. 
For better overview in "card deck styles" list in settings please at first change <StyleDescription value="PokerTH default card deck" /> 
to <StyleDescription value="my custom card deck" />. Maybe you also like to rename the defaultdeckstyle.xml to mycustomcardstyle.xml 
and directory name "default" to "mycustomdeck" or something similar.
Now you can start change/edit gfx files.

If you take a look into all files from 0.png to 51.png you will see which card value belongs to which number. 
It is VERY IMPORTANT to let the filenames untouched. PokerTH will always take 0.png for "diamond 2", 51.png for "club ace" and 
24.png for "heart king" for example. Also a flipside image called "flipside.png" have to be into the card deck directory.

The SIZE for all cards should be 48x76 pixel. If the size of an imgage will not fit 48x76 pixel PokerTH will scale it automatically. 
But picture scaling will cause some speed losses when drawing animations and something like this. 


2.2 Test your deck
--------------------------------
To test your deck just load it into PokerTH with "Settings" -> "Style" -> "Card Deck Styles" --> "Add ...".
When you have selected your file the value of "StyleDescription" is shown in the list. Select this entry in the list and click "Activate". 
Closing the Settings dialog will refresh the style of the card deck.

If you do changes in your mycustomcardstyle.xml there is no need to re-add it into settings or restart PokerTH. The simplest way is just
to open settings dialog and close it immediately. This will refresh the card deck style and show your changes.


2.3 Distribute your deck
-------------------------------
When your card deck style is ready to distribute you should complete the style information StyleDescription, StyleMaintainerEMail and Preview. 

Next step is editing the copyright.txt. Here you need to change "Maintainer" to your name and "EMail" to your valid mail address. 
Please read the copyright declaration carefully. If you edited a free licenced gfx file you need to add the source address of the file 
and corresponding licence information.

If you style is ready to be shipped please pack the whole directory into a zip archive and send it to anybody you like. If you like your 
style to be added into skin gallery on http://www.pokerth.net please send the archive to webmaster@pokerth.net. We cannot promise that 
every style will be added, but if everything works fine and the legal issues are also clear there should be no problem.

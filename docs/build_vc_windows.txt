These are the instructions to compile PokerTH on Windows using MSVC 2005 Express Edition.

1. Get and install MSVC 2005 Express Edition (English version is strongly recommended).

2. Get and install Service Pack 1 for MSVC 2005 Express Edition

3. Get and install a QT related Hotfix for MSVC 2005 SP1:

English - Visual Studio 2005 - VS80sp1-KB930859-X86-ENU.exe

More information on this:

4. Get and install a new Microsoft Platform SDK

This step can be left out if you use MSVC 2005 Professional instead of the Express Edition.

5. Get open source QT 4.3.2 [zip file] from Trolltech.
It supports MSVC 2005, no patch is needed.

6. Compile QT, make sure you set the QTDIR environment variable before.

7. Get boost and bjam and compile boost
See http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html

Now the worst part:
8. Get and compile(!) (do not use precompiled version) SDL and SDL_mixer
(this is a bit tricky, contact me for binaries if you wish)

9. Run
qmake -tp vc pokerth_lib.pro
qmake -tp vc pokerth_game.pro
qmake -tp vc pokerth_server.pro
in the pokerth directory

10. Create an sln file and add the three projects.

11. Set the project dependencies (pokerth_game and pokerth depend on pokerth_lib).

12. Set the "Program Database File Name" in the Properties section C/C++
for each project to a unique name.

13. Edit the library directories and the linker dependencies of the Debug
configuration, make them point to debug locations.

14. Rebuild Solution.

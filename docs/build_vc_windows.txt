These are the instructions to compile PokerTH on Windows using MSVC 2008 Express Edition.

1. Get and install MSVC 2008 Express Edition (English version is strongly recommended).

2. Get and install a new Microsoft Platform SDK

This step can be left out if you use MSVC 2008 Professional instead of the Express Edition.

4. Get open source QT 4.3.3 [zip file] from Trolltech.
It supports MSVC 2008, no patch is needed.

Compile QT, make sure you set the QTDIR environment variable before.

5. Get boost 1.34.1 and bjam (latest version) and compile boost
See http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/windows.html

6. Get and compile(!) (do not use precompiled version) OpenSSL
The OpenSSL build script requires perl, which can be downloaded for example here:
http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/
Also, an assembler is recommended for this step, which comes for example with the WDK:
http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/DevTools/WDK/WDKpkg.mspx
Basically you have to run (within the OpenSSL directory):

perl Configure VC-WIN32 no-shared
ms\do_masm
nmake -f ms\nt.mak

After compiling OpenSSL, move the output from inc32 and out32 to include and lib.

7. Get and compile(!) (do not use precompiled version) SDL and SDL_mixer.

8. Run
qmake -tp vc -recursive
in the pokerth directory. This will create a solution and project files.
Open the solution.

9. Set the "Program Database File Name" in the Properties section C/C++
for each project to a unique name.

10. Edit the library directories and the linker dependencies of the Debug
configuration, make them point to debug locations.

11. Rebuild the Solution.
